my .vim folder
==============

2010-07-23 16:17:56 - Added [git-vim][http://github.com/motemen/git-vim.git]  Had to add runtime path to .vimrc to get vim to see plugins on Windows.  Also interesting, this only works if you open a file directly with vim, not with :e.  Otherwise git fails because it doesn't think it's in the repository.  I'm going to test at home on my mac to see if this is a Windows issue or a vim issue.
